### Research

I'm currently part of [Prof. Rob Ness](http://sites.utm.utoronto.ca/ness/content/research)'s lab at the [University of Toronto Mississauga](http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/biology/), investigating the genome of the model organism _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_ in trying to answer fundamental questions about genome evolution and recombination rate variation. Most if not all of my work is done in Python, R (I am an unapologetic tidyverse enthusiast), and the Unix shell/bash. More about the project can be found [here](https://github.com/aays/fiftyshadesofgreen/wiki).

I come from more of a microbiology background; after obtaining a B.Sc. degree from the University of Toronto, I spent much of 2016 working on a microbial community profiling project at [Sporometrics](http://sporometrics.com) as part of the [COWALY](http://cowaly.com) international research consortium. There, under the co-supervision of [Prof. Keiko Yoshioka](http://labs.csb.utoronto.ca/yoshioka/) and [Dr. Yaima Arocha Rosete](http://www.sporometrics.com/company/team/dr-yaima-arocha-rosete/), I used both sequence-based and culturing methods in order to profile endophytic microbial diversity in coconut tree samples obtained from Grand-Lahou, CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Here's a [one-minute video summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59eKe4kp1bU) I made about my work.

### Not Research

Outside of my primary work, I also have a strong interest in data science and pedagogical approaches to programming and analytical skills. From mid-2016 to late 2017, I served as the Director for Data Science Education at [STEM Fellowship](http://stemfellowship.org), a Canada-wide non-profit that promotes education in scholarly writing and data science for STEM students. 

In leading our efforts towards data science education, I focused on developing means of promoting computational thinking and programming ability; working towards empowering students at the high school and undergraduate levels by providing them with relevant experiences and skills at relatively early stages of their academic careers. This involved two large-scale projects: from late 2016 - early 2017, I ran the organization's flagship [Big Data Challenge for High School Students](http://stemfellowship.org/big-data-challenge/), in addition to conceptualizing, organizing, and running STEM Fellowship's [first Big Data Challenge at the undergraduate level](https://bigdatachallenge.github.io), delivered in May 2017 at the University of Toronto campus.

Under my tenure, STEM Fellowship was named a finalist for the [Canadian Open Data Rising Star 2017 award](http://opendatasummit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CanadianOpenDataAwards2017JuryStatementFINAL.pdf) at the fourth [Canadian Open Data Summit](http://opendatasummit.ca), held at Edmonton, Alberta; we were also presented with a [letter of appreciation from the Government of Canada](http://stemfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/honourable_scroll.jpg) for our efforts. 

My work with STEM Fellowship also led to my becoming a proud [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/advisors#!members) advisor. LaTeX is fantastic and you should use it - the more collaboratively the better!

Outside of my work in and around data science education, I've also quite happily found myself caught up on Toronto's burgeoning civic tech scene. The amazing community at [Civic Tech Toronto](http://www.civictech.ca) has been instrumental in nurturing my interest there - and the pizza's always great, too.

Moreover, I'm broadly interested in politics and global affairs, where time allows. I've contributed as a compliance analyst to the Munk School of Global Affairs' [2015 G7 Schloss Elmau Summit Final Compliance Report](http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/evaluations/2015compliance-final/), and also to the Hangzhou report from the Munk School's [G20 Research Group](http://www.g20.utoronto.ca). 

Finally, I'm a bit of a guitar enthusiast; having spent my teenage years being very much a metal guy, I now squander inordinate amounts of time trying to wrap my head around jazz guitar playing. I'm still not very good at it.
