### Research

I'm currently doing research work in [Prof. Rob Ness](http://sites.utm.utoronto.ca/ness/content/research)'s lab at the [University of Toronto Mississauga](http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/biology/), investigating the landscape of recombination across the genome of the model organism _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_ in trying to answer fundamental questions about genome evolution and recombination rate variation. Most if not all of my work is done in Python, R (I am an unapologetic tidyverse enthusiast), and the Unix shell/bash.

I come from more of a microbiology background; after obtaining a B.Sc. degree from the University of Toronto, I spent much of 2016 working on a microbial community profiling project at [Sporometrics](http://sporometrics.com) as part of the [COWALY](http://cowaly.com) international research consortium. There, under the supervision of [Prof. Keiko Yoshioka](http://labs.csb.utoronto.ca/yoshioka/) and [Dr. Yaima Arocha Rosete](http://www.sporometrics.com/company/team/dr-yaima-arocha-rosete/), I used both sequence-based and culturing methods in order to profile endophytic microbial diversity in coconut tree samples obtained from Grand-Lahou, CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Here's a [one-minute video summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59eKe4kp1bU) I made about my work.

### Not Research

I also serve as the Director for Data Science Education at [STEM Fellowship](http://stemfellowship.org), a Canada-wide non-profit that promotes education in scholarly writing and data science for STEM students. In leading our efforts towards the latter, I'm interested in developing [new pedagogical approaches](http://stemfellowship.org/big-data-challenge/) towards analytical skills and computational thinking; working towards empowering students at the high school and undergraduate levels by providing them with relevant experiences and skills at relatively early stages of their academic careers. I'm actively on the lookout for passionate people to work with to this end, so if that describes you, let's chat.

My work with STEM Fellowship has led to my becoming a proud [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/advisors#!members) advisor. LaTeX is fantastic and you should use it - the more collaboratively the better!

Within the context of my dabblings in data science, I've also quite happily found myself caught up on Toronto's burgeoning civic tech scene. The amazing community at [Civic Tech Toronto](http://www.civictech.ca) has been instrumental in nurturing my interest there - and the pizza's always great, too.

Moreover, I'm broadly interested in politics and global affairs, where time allows. I've contributed as a compliance analyst to the Munk School of Global Affairs' [2015 G7 Schloss Elmau Summit Final Compliance Report](http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/evaluations/2015compliance-final/), and also to the upcoming Hangzhou report from the Munk School's [G20 Research Group](http://www.g20.utoronto.ca). 

Finally, I'm a bit of a guitar enthusiast; having spent my teenage years being very much a metal guy, I now squander inordinate amounts of time trying to wrap my head around jazz guitar playing. I'm still not very good at it.
